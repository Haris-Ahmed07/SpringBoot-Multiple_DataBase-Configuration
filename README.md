# SpringBoot-Multiple_DataBase-Configuration
 This repository demonstrates the configuration and usage of multiple databases within a single application. It leverages Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for two databases and Spring Data MongoDB for the third one. Each database has its own dedicated set of configurations, models, repositories, and controllers.
